My name is Jake Januzelli, and I use this site as a space to write on whatever I'm currently thinking about; setting things down in writing forces me to clarify them.

Here is an incomplete list of things I'm interested in:

### Philosophy
There are at least three ways that I've found reading and thinking about philosophy to be helpful to me.
1. **How to be a person** The most important problem that anyone has to contend with in life is how to be who they are. This is not necessarily a question of ethics, but what it means to live an 'ideal life'. Philosophers have argued about this for thousands of years, and everyone from Nietzsche to Aurelius to Singer to Aristotle has their own view of the answer.
2. **Concrete knowledge**
This case is quite rare, but I'll wager most of us have heard someone complain that Merriam-Webster is amending the definition of 'literally', or ask why 'people aren't allowed to be skeptical in science anymore', when a cursory investigation into Wittgenstein or Kuhn will answer these questions easily.
3. **Puzzle solving**
This is where I lump most of metaphysics (is there a Substance? do people have a Mind? are numbers Real?) which is amusing to think about but practically of little consequence (even to those who purport to live and die by metaphysical truths).

I've enjoyed the work of William James, Nietzsche, Hume, Berkeley, and Augustine, among others.

### Mathematics & Cryptography
My interests are mostly in number theory and theoretical cryptography (and their intersection). Recently I've been following the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization program.

### Literature
