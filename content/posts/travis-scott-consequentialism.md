Consequentialism has no good way of handling multi-causal events, and correctly assigning moral blame/praise to the events.

Example: Suppose I give $.01 to a pedophile. Is this moral or immoral consequentially? I am giving money to a pedophile, which makes it easier for them buy child pornography. However, $.01 by itself cannot buy anything. In a vacuum, this is a morally blameless act: the pedophile cannot do anything with x + .01 dollars that they could not have already done with x dollars.

However, now 50,000 people give $.01 to a pedophile. He now has $500, and can go and buy some child pornography with it. Linearity dictates in this case that of the total moral blame B to be assigned, each contributor has B/50000 of it.

But the only reason that a morally blamable act could occur was because of all the other contributors, like we already said. Suppose that the cheapest child porn the pedophile could get their hands on was $50. Then contributions up to $49.99 should be morally blameless, as they cannot cause any blamable act to occur.

If instead the pedophile chose to buy the $50 worth of child porn, amounting in some blame B’, my moral blame is now B’/5000, despite the fact that my actions haven’t changed.

The “in a vacuum” case is more usefully applied to celebrities/big corporations. By giving $.50 Spotify streaming revenue to Travis Scott, or $3 to Chik-fil-a, I’m technically giving them money, but $.50 has literally zero effect on Travis Scott’s life: consequentialist moral blame must be based on a concrete consequence, and none exist here.

In fact, making a big deal out of these kinds of transactions is the domain of the virtue ethicist, masquerading as a consequentialist.
