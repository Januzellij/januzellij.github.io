I am a computer scientist working on the foundations of cryptography and the security of practical cryptographic protocols. 

Beginning in Fall 2025 I will be a PhD student in computer science at Columbia University, advised by [James Bartusek](https://sites.google.com/view/jamesbartusek). I completed my masters in computer science at Oregon State University, co-advised by [Jiayu Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/jiayux/home) and [Mike Rosulek](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/). Before that, I received an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Cornell University.

My other interests include cinema, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and science fiction.
