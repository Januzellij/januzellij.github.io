<section id="section">
    <p>My name is Jake Januzelli, and I use this site as a space to write on whatever I&rsquo;m currently thinking about; setting things down in writing forces me to clarify them.</p>
<p>Here is an incomplete list of things I&rsquo;m interested in:</p>
<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy <a href="#philosophy" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>There are at least three ways that I&rsquo;ve found reading and thinking about philosophy to be helpful to me.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How to be a person</strong> The most important problem that anyone has to contend with in life is how to be who they are. This is not necessarily a question of ethics, but what it means to live an &lsquo;ideal life&rsquo;. Philosophers have argued about this for thousands of years, and everyone from Nietzsche to Aurelius to Singer to Aristotle has their own view of the answer.</li>
<li><strong>Concrete knowledge</strong>
This case is quite rare, but I&rsquo;ll wager most of us have heard someone complain that Merriam-Webster is amending the definition of &lsquo;literally&rsquo;, or ask why &lsquo;people aren&rsquo;t allowed to be skeptical in science anymore&rsquo;, when a cursory investigation into Wittgenstein or Kuhn will answer these questions easily.</li>
<li><strong>Puzzle solving</strong>
This is where I lump most of metaphysics (is there a Substance? do people have a Mind? are numbers Real?) which is amusing to think about but practically of little consequence (even to those who purport to live and die by metaphysical truths).</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the work of William James, Nietzsche, Hume, Berkeley, and Augustine, among others.</p>
<h3 id="mathematics--cryptography">Mathematics &amp; Cryptography <a href="#mathematics--cryptography" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>My interests are mostly in number theory and theoretical cryptography (and their intersection). Recently I&rsquo;ve been following the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization program.</p>
<h3 id="literature">Literature <a href="#literature" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>You can see what I&rsquo;ve read in the past and what I&rsquo;m reading now <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/jakej" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
