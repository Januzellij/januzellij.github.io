      <p>What is a probability? The junkyard cyclone.</p>
<p>There’s a popular saying concerning the chance that abiogenesis could come about without the assistance of a Divine creator: “comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747”. There are plenty of biological objections to this, but I want to use it as an example to talk about probabilities: what they are and what they can tell you.</p>
<p>When someone says “The chance of X happening is Y” they usually mean this in one of two ways. These are known as Frequentist and Bayesian respectively.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Long Run
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Belief</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Say a friend comes up to you with a quarter and asks you what the chances are that they’ll flip two heads in a row. You respond with 1/4. How did you get that number? You constructed a mathematical model of the situation: modeling the coin tosses as independent, and as likely to come up heads as tails. You then calculated an answer of (1/2)^2 = 1/4.</p>
<p>Now say you’re with a friend at a horse race, and they ask you what the chances are of your horse winning. You think for a minute and guess 2/3. Here there’s not even an attempt at a model (unless you’re an undercover professional): instead this probability represents your belief in the likelihood of an event. For instance, if your friend offers you a bet where they give you $5 if the horse wins and you give them $5 if it loses, you should (barring extenuating circumstances) take that bet given your guess of 2/3. This belief can certainly be based on empirical evidence like past race results, but in both cases, these statements are non-empirical: you cannot conclude anything about reality from them. They can be important tools to use when making decisions about the future, but fundamentally they’re subjective: the choice of a model (in example 1) and the choice of empirical evidence (in example 2) are both subjective. And in both cases, there’s no reason to be sure that your end result accurately reflects reality.</p>
<p>Why this junkyard argument is shit.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Because of what we just said, a probabilistic argument (the change of abiogenesis without a Divine creator is super small) is not sufficient to establish an empirical claim (abiogenesis couldn’t have happened without a Divine creator).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post hoc probabilities do not exist. We can’t rewind Earth’s history so frequentism is useless.</p>
</li>
</ol>
